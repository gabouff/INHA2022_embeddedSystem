Our project is aimed for an industrial application because the heavy mechanical machinery are usually automatic and dangerous for worker to approach. 
As a response, we give the possibility to :
- run the machine in 4 ways. 
- The machine is secured with a password. 
- Moreover, it prevents the worker with error messages and LED blink, 
- if worker are in danger, and even stop it.
